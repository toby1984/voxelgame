voxelgame
=========

A simple voxel engine that uses 3D simplex noise to procedurally generate an infinite,random terrain. You need to have a OpenGL 2.0+ compatible graphics card and appropriate drivers installed.

Use the mouse and WASD to navigate, right-click to place blocks and left-click to 'shoot'.
